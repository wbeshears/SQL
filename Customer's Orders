--query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made. 
Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.

Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent
SELECT c.name,c.email,sum(o.price) as spent


FROM customers c

ON c.id=o.customer_id

GROUP BY c.name
